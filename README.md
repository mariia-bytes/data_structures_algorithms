# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository features complete implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms that are frequently encountered in technical interviews.

## About

This project is designed to enhance my understanding of these concepts through practical application. The implementations are based on the Udemy course:

**[DSA for Cracking the Coding Interview: Animated Examples for Faster Learning and Deeper Understanding](https://www.udemy.com/course/dsa-for-cracking-the-coding-interview/)**

I've adapted the course material with my own modifications to align with my current proficiency in C++.


## Complited Data Structures

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack

## In Progress

- Queue
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Algorithms
